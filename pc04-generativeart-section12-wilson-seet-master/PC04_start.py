This code draws two wiggling turtles that mirror each other's movements
There's a random value added to the vertical position, which makes the waves wiggly.
I chose a monochrome palette becuase it's cool!

**** BORROWING THIS CODE? READ FIRST ****
*                                       *
*   You MUST modify this code if you    *
*   borrow it!. That means you'll       *
*   change the pattern (wave freq,      *
*   position, color, thickness).        *
*   You must cite this example code!    *

#You can experiment by making 

# You must make 2 turtle variables
# You must use 2 for loops (a nested for loop counts as 2!)
# You must use at least 1 random element (something from the random library)
# Don't forget to comment your code! (what does each for loop do? What does the random function you'll use do?)
