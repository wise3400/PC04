# PC04_startcode
Start code, random &amp; multi turtle examples for PC04
<br>
<br>
For this assignment, you'll be making generative art--animations or drawings that have a random element. These can be colors, sizes of shapes or lines, positions, direction a turtle faces--anything!
<br>
<br>
Please feel free to use the start code and check out the example code to help you get started.
<br>
<br>
<b> WORK SMART! </b>
<br>If you're feeling behind or overwhelmed, you can use your PC03 assignment and focus on the NEW CONCEPTS instead of the creative aspect. You will likely get the same creative score as your PC03 grade (feel free to ask your LA for that grade if it's not released yet).
